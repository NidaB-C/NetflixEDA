# Project Title: "Evolving Landscapes of Television: An Analytical Dive into TV Show Trends on Netflix"

### Objective:
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of TV shows available on Netflix, focusing on their evolution over time, the impact of the pandemic on genre popularity, regional production trends, and the relationship between IMDb scores, votes, and genres. The analysis will leverage a primary dataset from Kaggle along with supplementary data from the OMDB API. By examining various aspects such as maturity ratings, genre popularity, production trends, and viewer ratings, the study aims to offer valuable insights for content creators, media strategists, and streaming service analysts.

### Data Sources:
- Primary Dataset: Netflix Movies and Shows dataset from Kaggle, focusing on TV shows (approx. 2500 data points) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maso0dahmed/netflix-movies-and-shows/data
- Secondary Data: Supplemental information from the OMDB API, providing additional details like ratings, languages, and production countries.

### Key Questions:
#### 1. Maturity Rating Evolution:
##### Team Member Responsible - Ammarah
- How do different age certifications (like TV-MA, TV-14) perform in terms of quantity and popularity?
- Does this reflect any broader market trends or shifts in audience demographics?

#### 2. Pandemic and Reality TV Popularity:
##### Team Member Responsible - Safa
- Was there a significant rise in the popularity of reality TV shows during the pandemic, and has this increase been sustained post-pandemic?

#### 3. Genre Production Patterns:
##### Team Member Responsible - Nana
- What can be inferred about Netflix's content strategy based on the genres and types of shows produced?
- How has the diversity of production regions and languages changed over time on Netflix?
- How does Netflix's content portfolio compare with its initial years versus the more recent years?

#### 4. IMDb Score, Votes, and Genre Relationship:

#### 2. Individual Analysis Focus:
 - Each team member will focus on one specific question, conducting in-depth analysis and visualization.
 - Utilize statistical methods and data visualization techniques to extract insights.

#### 3. Data Visualization and Interpretation:
 - Employ tools like Python (Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization) to create insightful charts and graphs.

#### 4. Documentation and Presentation:
##### Team Member Responsible - Nida 
 - Maintaining documentation in a README file, and preparing the presentation slide deck.
